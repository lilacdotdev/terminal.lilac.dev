# Terminal.LilacCS.Dev
This Repo is a website created for my website's Subdomain, terminal.lilaccs.dev, with the intent to learn more about web-based graphcs.
This website is made using raw html/css/js, with no frameworks. This is to understand the ins and outs of JavaScript's potential.

The goal is to create a fun app that can showcase my abilities and desires to learn. Feel free to take a look around!
